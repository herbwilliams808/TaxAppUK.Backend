are liable to tax at the dividend nil rate, and if the dividend nil rate were omitted would you be liable to tax at the dividend upper rate
or additional rate? If 'Yes', the transfer is invalid. Where you are liable to tax at the savings nil rate, the savings nil rate applies.

It may be more beneficial for some customers to now have (some of) their deductions and allowances
from box A130 allocated against dividend income before savings income, the Savings income etc is at
boxes A145 to A147 and at boxes A160 to A162. If it's more beneficial to move reliefs and allowances
to dividends in the higher rate range to increase tax at the basic rate but reduce tax at the higher
dividend rate this working sheet may not give the correct answer. Overwrite the amounts in the middle
column to deduct the reliefs and allowances in the way which will result in the greatest reduction in your
liability to Income Tax.

If you think it may be more beneficial to order reliefs and allowances differently you may want to either file
your tax return online, let us do your calculation for you or speak to your tax advisor.

## Section 6: Allocate income to tax bands
If any box on this page is a minus figure, substitute zero.
The first £5,000 of savings income is taxed at 0%; but only if non-savings and savings income is
less than £17,570 (the personal allowance – £12,570 plus the savings starting rate band of £5,000).
Savings income in excess of the savings starting rate band, up to the lower of the amount of the excess
or the individual's savings allowance, is charged at the savings nil rate.

### Allocate taxable non-savings income to tax bands
#### Income
``` 
A165(NonSavingsIncome) = { A141( NonSavingsIncome ) }

A165a(NonSavingsIncomeInStarterRateBand) = min( A165(NonSavingsIncome), S2(StarterRateBand) )
```
#### Income in basic rate band (A166)
lower of (A165 minus A165a) and (S3 + A119)
```

  A165(NonSavingsIncome) - A165a(NonSavingsIncomeInStarterRateBand),
   S3( BasicRateBand ) + A119(AmountForExtendingBasicRateBand) )
```

#### Income above basic rate band (A167)
A165 minus (A165a + A166)
```

  A165a(NonSavingsIncomeInStarterRateBand) +

```

#### Intermediate rate band available (A167a)
larger of S4 and A119
``` 
A167a(IntermediateRateBandAvailable) = max( 
  S4(IntermediateRateBand),

#### Income in intermediate rate band (A167b)
lower of A167 and S4
```

```

#### Higher rate band available (A168)
``` 
A168(HigherRateBandAvailable) = S5(HigherRateBand)
```

#### Income in higher rate band (A169)
lower of (A167 minus A167b) and A168
```

  ( A167(NonSavingsIncomeAboveBasicRateBand) - A167b(NonSavingsIncomeInIntermediateRateBand) ),
  A168(HigherRateBandAvailable) )
```

#### Income above higher rate band (A169a)
A165 minus (A165a + A166 + A167b + A169)
``` 
A169a(NonSavingsIncomeAboveHigherRateBand) = {
  A165(NonSavingsIncome) -
